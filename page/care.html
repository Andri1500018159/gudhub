        <p><i><b>Weekly</b></i>: Once a week, your natural stone floor should be dust mopped with a cotton dust mop (12” 18” wide head). In week 2, your natural stone floor should be mopped with a cotton string mop and a stone soap solution consisting of 2 gallons of warm clean water and 6 8 oz of stone soap (pH7). Mop floor with a damp (well wrung out) mop of this solution. Be careful not to subject floor to too much water. Allow floor to air dry.</p>
      <p><i><b>Yearly or biyearly</b></i>: When floor becomes dull, loses its luster, numerous scratches appear and water spotting occurs, it is time to call Illinois Granite & Marble Ltd. professionally trained stone technicians to restore your floor back to original condition.
